### Hi there 👋
I'm ENDERZOMBI102 (a.k.a. ender), a Computer Science student who is passionate about programming and a lover of nature.  
I mostly develop in C++, Zig, Python and Java ( Java/Kotlin mostly for `Minecraft` mods ),
but I'm also experienced with Kotlin, Rust, (Type|Java)Script and other languages.

I've worked on the most desperate platforms and with various technologies,
from a simple socket-based chat system to the codebases of the avionics for model rockets,
passing by game engines and CLI/GUI tools.
