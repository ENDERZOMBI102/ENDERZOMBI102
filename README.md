### Hi there 👋
I'm ENDERZOMBI102, or just ender, I'm a Computer Science student who is also passionate of programming and nature.
I mostly develop in Java 8/17, Kotlin, C++ or Python ( Java/Kotlin mostly for `Minecraft Java Edition` mods ), but I'm also experienced with Rust and (Type|Java)Script and many more languages.

I've worked on the most desparate platforms and with the most diverse technologies, from a simple socket-based chat app to avionics for model rockets passing by game engines and CLI/GUI tools.
