### Hi there 👋
I'm ENDERZOMBI102 (a.k.a. ender), a Computer Science student, passionate for programming & loving of nature.  
I mostly develop in C++, Java, Kotlin or Python ( Java/Kotlin mostly for `Minecraft Java Edition` mods ), but I'm also experienced with Rust, (Type|Java)Script and many more languages.

I've worked on the most desperate platforms and with the most diverse technologies, from a simple socket-based chat app to avionics for model rockets, passing by game engines and CLI/GUI tools.
